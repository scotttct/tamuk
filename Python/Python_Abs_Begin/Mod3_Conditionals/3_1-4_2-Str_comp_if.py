#CONDITIONALS: COMPARISON OPERATORS WITH IF
# [ ] get input for a variable, answer, and ask user 'What is 8 + 13? : '
# [ ] print messages for correct answer "21" or incorrect answer using if/else
# note: input returns a "string"

#My solution below

# answer = "You are correct: 8 + 13 = 21"
# user_input = input("What is the sum of 8 + 13? ")
# wrong_answer = ("Sorry! That was not what 8 + 13 equals! ")
# x = 21

# if user_input == x:
#     print(answer)
# else:
#     print(wrong_answer)
    

# found on github

#define the variable
variable = 21
#define the question with input in order to have a result
input ("What is 8 + 13? : ")
#define the input as equal to the varialbe to have an if else stataement
if input == variable:
      print("correct")
else:
      print("incorrect")

      #both answers give the incorrect answer?????Why?
