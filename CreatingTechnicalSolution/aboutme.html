           <p>
                Growing up in Ivoryton Connecticut, a small town in the mid-southern part of the state, 
                was a wonderful experience. Ivoryton is also a part of Essex, another small town that has its won elementary school.
                However, once students become middleschool age they go to John Winthop Junior High School, and
                then onto Valley Regional High School form 9th to 12th grade when they graduate.  John Winthop and Valley 
                Regional are both part of Regional District 4 that comprises of Essex, Deep River and Chester.

           <h3>
               Elementary School Years
           </h3>
           <p>
               Going to Essex Elementary School in Centerbrook, CT was a wonderful experience, with small class sizes and 
               a small town vibe.  There I met wonderful people who became lifetime friends, more like family really. 
               The one thing I enjoy most in life began at Essex Elementary School, and that is Cycling.  A teacher brought in 
               a guest who show us all about road cycling and racing and organized an afterschool cycling club.  Mr. Clark, was a great
               mentor, who also owned the local bike shop.  That sparked a lifelong passion that lead to many adventures. More about that 
               latter...
